# Adventure Works – Integrated Power BI Analytics Project  
A complete end-to-end business intelligence solution built using **Power BI**, integrating sales, product profitability, and operational efficiency into a unified analytical environment.

---

##  Project Overview  
This project provides a  Adventure Works using **three dashboards**, each targeting a different business domain:

1. **Sales & Customer Performance**
2. **Product Profitability & Production Cost Analysis**
3. **Operational & Machine Efficiency Tracking**

All dashboards are connected through a unified semantic model, allowing users to move through the business flow seamlessly—from sales performance → to product profitability → to operational efficiency.

# Dashboards Included

---

##  1. Sales & Customer Performance Dashboard  
This dashboard provides a high-level view of commercial performance.

### **Key Features**
- Total Sales, Profit, Quantity Sold, and Returns  
- Year-over-year and category-level performance  
- Top-performing and low-performing regions (Geographic hotspots)  
- Customer segment profitability  
- Dynamic slicers (Year, Category, Region)

### **Insights Delivered**
- Bikes represent **94%+** of revenue  
- Strong sales growth across recent years  
- Returns remain low (≈972 units)  
- Key customer segments significantly impact profitability  
- Certain regions under-perform and require intervention

- Full product-level financial table (Cost, Price, Margin %, Profit)  
- Bottom 5 products by profit  
- Profitability vs Average Selling Price scatter plot  
- Category switching (Accessories, Bikes, Clothing, Components)

### **Insights Delivered**
- Clear identification of low-margin and unprofitable products  
- High-margin product groups drive most profitability  
- Some products have high price but poor margin → pricing optimization  
- Supports decisions such as discontinuing or redesigning low-profit items

##  3. Operational & Machine Efficiency Dashboard  
This dashboard monitors **downtime**, **machine utilization**, and overall **production efficiency**.

### **Key Features**
- Downtime Hours  
- Machine Efficiency  
- Utilization Rate  
- Breakdown of downtime reasons  
- Machine-Level Efficiency and Uptime  
- Trends and root-cause visualizations

### **Insights Delivered**
- Total Downtime ≈ **394 hours** → high impact on production  
- Utilization at **79%** → unused capacity available  
- Key downtime causes:  
  - Material Shortage  
  - Machine Head  
  - Blow Head  
- Machine3 and Machine2 show efficiency gaps compared to Machine1
